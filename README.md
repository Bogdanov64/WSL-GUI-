# WSL GUI 
 Use X11 GUI in WSL 
 
 Download Xming from http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/  and install .
 Open your  linux distribution
 Edit text with nano/ vim or your favourite text editor in ~/.bashrc
 write     
 export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0 # XMING Server
 Repower your linux distribution and you are can use your GUI programs .
  
I recomand to make automaticall startup Xming .
